Every four months, there is an event called [Ludum Dare][ld]. It is a 48 hour solo game competition, and I competed this time! I designed all the gameplay, wrote all the code, did all the art and composed all the music for this little piece. You can watch a short gameplay video below, or [play it on Kongregate now][game]! I hope you enjoy it!
