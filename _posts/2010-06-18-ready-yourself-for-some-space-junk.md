The fine folks over at [Boing Boing][bb] have issued [a contest revolving around chiptunes][contest]. The deadline is July 5, so we figured it might be fun to take a break from our other projects to throw something together in a few weeks.

Without giving too much away, you should know that our game is about music and space junk. Go ahead and take a look at this picture.

Now, stay tuned for more news as the game is developed.
