It boggles my mind, but somehow, <em>The Game Studio</em>'s first official game release, <em>Space Junk</em>, won first place in <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2010/07/16/boing-boing-game-dev.html">BoingBoing</a>'s "Games Inspired By Music" competition!

![Winners!][winner]

We beat out a lot of other great games, and in the end, it is all thanks to our players and voters to get us this far! As a reward, keep your eyes open for a new version of <em>Space Junk</em>!
