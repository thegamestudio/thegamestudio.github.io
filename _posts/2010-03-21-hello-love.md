Ever wonder what a game developer does in his free time? In my case, <a href="http://www.thegamestudioinc.com/games/hello.love">I make more games</a>. Once I make those games, I go around posting them on message boards with <a href="http://love2d.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=5&amp;t=1432">cryptic</a> <a href="http://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=11732.0">messages</a>. Then I chuckle a bit to myself at my cleverness then pass out due to sleep deprivation.

You can play the game now by installing <a href="http://love2d.org">Löve</a> (real cool Lua-based game framework) and downloading and running <a href="http://www.thegamestudioinc.com/games/hello.love">hello.love</a>. You can also continue reading.

<em>hello löve</em> is a procedurally generated maze game developed in approximately fourteen hours. It was scripted in Lua, a language which I knew nothing about until fifteen hours ago. It wound up being lots of fun!

There are three different play modes. The first shows the entire map. It's a simple maze. The second uncovers the map as you go. The third only shows the tiles nearest to you.

There's no scoring or points of any kind. It's just a silent search for treasure. I'm sure the treasure is a metaphor for something. I'm deep.
