Last weekend, _The Game Studio_ participated in [Ludum Dare] [ld-comp] and completed two games! The theme was "Escape."

## Escape From Music Manor: A Rhythmic Roguelike!

Zachary created a single-button rhythm roguelike called [_Escape From Music Manor: A Rhythmic Roguelike!_] [efmm]. In it, you must escape the dastardly Music Manor by timing your button presses to select your actions, all to the tune of a procedurally-generated soundscape.

- [Play the revised version.] [efmm-revised]

## Solar Escape

Evan created a space escape game called [_Solar Escape_] [solar]. In it, you must escape the explosion of a dying star by slingshotting your ship through planets while avoiding space debris that will slow you down.

![Hmm... this is exactly where I don't want to be.] [solar-img]
