Listen in as we discuss Ludum Dare, used games, Shadow of the Colossus, and more! Special guest Stephen Robertson tries to convince us to play Dwarf Fortress while Noah gushes over the Scott Pilgrim game. This week's music was brought to you by [smiletron], whom you should check out on 8 Bit Collective.
