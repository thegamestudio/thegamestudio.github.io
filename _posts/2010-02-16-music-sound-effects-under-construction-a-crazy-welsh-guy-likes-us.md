An important part of any video game experience is the sound. Since Timbo and I are neither minstrels or soundsmiths, we can't bring the full experience to our players. <a href="http://www.hyperduck.co.uk/">HyperDuck music studios</a> approached us and asked if we currently had anyone developing soundscapes and sound effects for Monolith. Since we didn't (and we aren't liars), we told them that we'd be honored to have them create the sounds for Monolith. (If you're in the mood for awesome game music, you might want to <a href="http://www.hyperduck.co.uk/">pop on over to their website</a> and check out some of the work they've done.)

Finally, Monolith has received it's first non-solicited shout out. Aaron Spex Barker who does a daily videolog on <a href="http://www.facebook.com/video/?id=505022177">Facebook</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/spexbeanfarmer">YouTube</a> mentioned Monolith in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uu6qJD6WVd4">his most recent vlog</a>.  I'd like to thank him, and if anyone else would like to comment on the first few looks we've released or would like more screenshots or media for the game to share with friends and readers, we'd be more than happy to share!
